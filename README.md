# graphicsinCnetPlayground
using graphic class in c net and create a new control user defined with permanent graphics.
how you see in tha sample this is made just declaring a global Graphics g object who is instantiated
at load time of control and a Image img object who is instantiated to load time also.
at the loading the Graphics g object will be set to link the Image img.
all the updates will be made to img and then the img will be writed to the screen each time the paint event occure.
and i create a user defined control that contain this implementation of the graphic permanent capability and i create an aditional project that load this user defined control and use it.
